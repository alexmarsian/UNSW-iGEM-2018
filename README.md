# UNSW-iGEM-2018
All the files for the search tool, and matlab models for the UNSW iGEM team 2018, created by Alex

Read the SearchREADME.txt and BuildREADME.txt files!

All of the files contain a first line of the type: #! /Users/Amarsing/anaconda3/bin/python

This line is unique to each computer, and can be found by typing 'which python' at the command line.
The result can be pasted into the top of each file after #! /

Alternatively before calling each file, simply add 'python' beforehand. 
E.g. using the search tool, one could type 'python search.py -h'
